# satellite-orbit-and-attitude-simulator
This is my personal side project (hobby) to realize satellite orbit and attitude simulator.

I'm planning to implement the following features for now.
* Targeting low earth orbit (LEO) satellite such as cubesat and microsatellite for now but I want to support deep space environment in the future. 
* Propagate orbit element with any perturbations.
* Calculate satellite attitude dynamics with any disturbance.
* Simulate satellite sensor and actuator equipment such as gyro, compass, sun-sensor, star-sensor, magnetorquer, thruster and so on...
* Determin orbit and attitude information by using the above simulated sensor and try to control them with well-known control methods.
* Simulate two or more satellites and realize a guidance control to approach each other.
* Visualize satellite orbit and attitude informations.
* and so on...

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about this code implementation or if I can help you with consulting / developing satellite development :)
